              production statistics tracking and planning complicated and time-consuming.
              Additionally, employee registration for company events was handled through separate channels, 
              with data processed manually as well.

              The company recruits seasonal workers from Finland and other countries, but the application process 
              was inefficient and fragmented. Employees applied via email without a standardized application form 
              or processing system. Each application required an individual response, and employee data had to be manually 
              transferred to the accounting system. When the employer organized transportation, 
              passenger lists were also created manually, adding to the administrative burden.

              Small businesses needing warehouse management systems face a challenging market situation. 
              Enterprise-level ERP solutions with WMS modules cost 100+ euros monthly and offer far more complexity than needed. 
              Simpler alternatives priced at 18-24 euros per month have significantly limited features or hidden event-based charges. 
              Many small businesses (providing storage services like tire warehouses, service stations, or frozen berry storage facilities) 
              still rely on outdated methods such as spreadsheets due to the lack of affordable, targeted solutions.

              The company's warehouse lacked an efficient system for locating components and tracking inventory. 
              Workers spent unnecessary time searching for items, and real-time inventory monitoring was difficult. 
              Although the company had an ERP system, it didn't provide dedicated tools for warehouse floor operations, 
              slowing down production processes.

              We developed SOP-Manager (Storage Order Pickup Manager), a web application that integrates directly with the

              We developed autonomous label printing terminals positioned directly at production workstations. 
              Each terminal consists of a single-board computer (SBC) connected to a touchscreen display, 
              RFID card reader, and label printer. Workers simply scan their personal RFID card containing 
              their employee ID, enter the quantity of labels needed through the touch interface, 
              and receive printed stickers immediately. The labeled products are later scanned in the warehouse, 
              automatically recording both employee performance metrics and product tracking data.

            <p class="project-info-desc">
              The terminals streamlined the production labeling process, eliminating manual recording and reducing 
              workflow interruptions. Workers gained instant access to label printing at their workstations, 
              while management received accurate, real-time production data.

            <p class="project-info-desc">
              The customer needed comprehensive video surveillance coverage across multiple locations, 
              including both indoor facilities and open outdoor areas. Existing security measures were insufficient 
              for monitoring large territories and preventing incidents.
            </p>
            <h3 class="project-info-subtitle"><span class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb project-info-subtitle-icon"></span>Solution</h3>
            <p class="project-info-desc">
              We designed and implemented a multi-location video surveillance system with over 10 cameras strategically 
              positioned across the customer's facilities.
            </p>
            <h3 class="project-info-subtitle"><span class="fa-solid fa-flag project-info-subtitle-icon"></span>Result</h3>
            <p class="project-info-desc">
              The customer received comprehensive surveillance coverage across all critical areas with reliable 24/7 monitoring capabilities.
              The hybrid connection approach (PoE and Wi-Fi) ensured stable operation in diverse environments while minimizing installation complexity. 
              High-quality recording and the alert system significantly improved security management.
